    "\n",
    "* season: indicates which season it is\n",
    "* rain: indicates whether it is raining\n",

A natural way to represent this structure is a Directed Acyclic Graph. We require the graph to be acyclic to prevent \"causal loops\"."

    "\n",
    "Structural Causal Model is a mathematical description of a Causal Graphical Model where variables are functions of other variables. Here, if we consider the \"sprinkler\" Causal Graphical Model, the variable \"season\" may only influence the variable \"wet\" through \"rain\" or \"sprinkler\", no matter what the actual functions are. This way of modeling structure is appealing because it has a natural way to describe interventions: we reach into the system and replace the value of one variable with one we choose."

    "* season: a binary version - dry (0) and rainy (1), randomly generated Bernoulli distribution \n",
    "* rain and sprinkler: conditioned by season but randomly generated - we can have rain in a dry season as well and sprinkler can be turned on in any season\n",

In this case the function could be regarded as simulating coin flips where `size=n__samples` sets the algorithm to flip the coin `n__samples` times and `p=0.5` makes it a fair coin with equal probabilitiy of head (1) or tail (0)."
